This program calculates factorials. It has a bug in it. Running the program gives the following output:

Factorial of 5: 120
Factorial of -3: -1

As you can see, it is not handling negative values correctly. While this logical error would be easy to spot in code, that is not always the case. Pretend you are unable to spot the cause of the logical error and write the following unit tests to help you identify it:

1. Write a test that passes in a positive value to the Factorial function.
2. Write a test that passes in a zero value to the Factorial function.
3. Write a test that passes in a negative value to the Factorial function.
